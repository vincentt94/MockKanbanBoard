  ## Description
  In order to better comprehend JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), with some provided starter code I was able to build and deploy a mock Kanban Board Application that allows a user to login, post, update, and delete a ticket within the Kanban Board.  The provided starter code already provided the majority of the application.  I was able to complete UI for the login, add authentication with JWT to the server API, and deploy the application to Render.  Please view the live deployed application here at: https://module14-ztqx.onrender.com/

  ## Installation
  There are no installation instructions.  Please view the applcation at: https://module14-ztqx.onrender.com/

  ## Usage
  In order to fully operate this application, a user must first login in order to authenticate and see the Kanban Board.  In order to do so please utilize some login information from the user-seeds.ts.  A user can enter any of the following usernames: JollyGuru, SunnyScribe, or RadiantComet.  When prompted with a password, the password is "password".

  ## Guidelines 
  No contributions necessary.

  ## Tests
  Once succesfully logged in and authenticated, a user can begin to create. update, or even delete tickets.  Simply click the "New Ticket" button on the top right if the user wishes to create a new ticket.  The user can then fill out the required fields (including ticket name, ticket status, ticket description, and select from a list of User ID's to indicate which user made this update).  Upon hitting submit form, the ticket will then be placed onto the Kanban Board in the correct column.  If a user wishes to update a ticket, they can simply click "Edit" within the ticket itself and change any information within the ticket fields.  If a user wishes to delete a ticket, there is also a "delete" option they may select right within the ticket.
